# Go Cloud Pubsub Unit-test Demo

A project which demonstrates how we can test GCP services SDK that don't expose interface.
The idea is to define our own interface and wrap the SDK struct so we can generate a mock using gomock.

## Code walkthrough

`mock` contains the mock of the interfaces that were generated by gomock

`pubsub_client` contains our interface that we defined to wrap the GCP PubSub client

`pubsub_service` is our main class that contains the method that we want to unit test. It uses pubsub_client to connect to GCP PubSub

`main.go` is the entry point which demonstrates how we can construct the **pubsub_client** and **pubsub_service** and glue them together
